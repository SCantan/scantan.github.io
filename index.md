# Simon Cantan
I'm an engineer currently working in ASP.NET C# on the server side and React on the client side. 

My current project is the Storm System, which is a system designed to allow web developers to quickly prototype ideas for websites without having to create the backbone of the system.

## Storm System
The Storm System is a system designed to allow the rapid creation of registration and reporting systems.

Registration and reporting systems are web applications that allow the end users to edit information on the system, and then report on it in different ways (tables, graphs, etc).

The Storm System is made up of a React application on the client side and a set of ASP.NET C# microservices on the server side, coordinated using a BFF.

### Typhoon
Typhoon is the client side React application for the Storm System. You can find it here:
